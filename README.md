# 🛡️ PassForge — Random Password Generator for Real Cyber Defense

> **"Weak passwords don’t just risk accounts — they invite breaches."**

PassForge is a **Python-based Random Password Generator** designed to forge **truly random, uncrackable passwords** — demonstrating how predictable passwords (names, birthdays, patterns) fail under real-world cyberattacks.

## ⚡ Why PassForge?

In the age of data breaches and credential leaks, password security is your first and most common line of defense.  
Yet millions still use *“password123”*, *their name + symbol*, or *birthdates* as passwords.  

🔐 **PassForge** exposes this weakness by generating unpredictable, high-entropy passwords — showing why randomness is power.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User defines the number of:
   - **Letters** (Uppercase + Lowercase)
   - **Symbols** (e.g. `! # $ % & *`)
   - **Numbers** (`0–9`)
2. The script randomly selects characters from each category.  
3. It **shuffles** them for total unpredictability.  
4. Outputs a final password that is nearly impossible to guess or brute-force.
